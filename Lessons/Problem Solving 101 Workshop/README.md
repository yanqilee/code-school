## Problem Solving 101 Workshop

You are not learning to program, you are learning to solve problems.

Programming languages like Java and JavaScript are tools you use to solve the problems. Much like learning a language, it is a way to communicate with your computer, but we must mold our thinking to effectively communicate with your computer by giving it the right set of instructions.

So far, your toolkit include:
- Variable declaration and assignments
- Primitive types (int, boolean, etc)
- String
- If statements
- Loops
- Arrays (e.g. [1,2,3,4,5])

Steps to solving a problem:
1. Understand the problem
- This is the most important step of the problem, read and reread the problem statement again and again until you have a solid understanding of the problem
- Look for things you are not clear about, ask questions
- Clarify uncertainties
- Any input I should look out for? (e.g. If I ask the user to enter a number, and that user typed "hi". What should be the correct behaviour? How should your program handle it?)

2. Run through an example

3. Break the problem down
- A big problem is hard
- Tons of smaller problems are easier to solve

4. Write out pseudocode/steps

5. Write code

6. Verify solution and debug

Tips:
- Don't rush to code, coding is the last step when you have understood everything else

What if I am stuck?
- Ask for help!
- Trace/debug
